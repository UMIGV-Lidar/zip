## Synopsis

`zip2` is a header-only library which provides an interface to iterate through two ranges at the same time.

## Code Example

	rosrun edge_detector edge_detector scan:=filtered_scan

## Motivation

Python's `zip` function is very nice and lends itself to use in range for loops.

## Installation

Run `catkin_make install` on the contents of this package, then `#include "zip2/zip2.h"` to make use of it.

`zip2` is authored and maintained by Gregory Meyer of UMIGV.
